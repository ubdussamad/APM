Advanced Pointing Mechanisms

The goal is to trace subtle movements of calibrated retina to imppliment a pointing device.


Initially it'll be implimented in pythpon and if it works or shows any promise, it'll be ported to C for performance gains. 

Perfomance is a big issue as the propsed device will be using web cam and thus this project **dosen't has a very hard ground to stand on.**

Realized issues with the idea uptil now:
	
	*Webcam resolution.
	*Framerate
	*Low light performance
	*Is this thing even possible?
	*The whole delay created due to this.
	*Eye Blinks
	*Click Inputs
